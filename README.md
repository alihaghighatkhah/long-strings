LONG STRINGS

you may some times need to shorten long strings loke Emails or usernames or other strings.
usualy this happens because breaking to new lines only happens with spaces. but Emails or
usernames don't include them.

there is two ways:

I've created a simple script to shorten these strings according to their length.
the script calculates the length of string with this in mind that "w" is more wide than "i",
likewise "M" and "K" and .. are more wide than "j" and "l".

2 - having a fixed room for the string, like Email, we can animate it by mouse hover. so that
client can read it.
